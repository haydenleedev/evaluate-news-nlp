# Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing

This project requires you to build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites.


## Getting started

It would probably be good to first get your basic project setup and functioning. Follow the steps from the course up to Lesson 4 but don't add Service Workers just yet. We won't need the service workers during development and having extra caches floating around just means there's more potential for confusion. So, fork this repo and begin your project setup.

Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`

### API
[Aylien API](https://developer.aylien.com/signup) has been used for this project.
The app should make a successful call to the api on form submission.

### Service Worker
The project has set up service workers in webpack.

### Testing
The project has jest installed.
